This repository contains a comprehensive collection of hands-on AWS cloud projects designed to build practical understanding of core cloud services and infrastructure management. The project covers essential AWS components including EC2, IAM, S3, VPC, Lambda, Route 53, RDS, SNS, and SQS, demonstrating how these services work individually and how they integrate to form a complete cloud architecture.

The process begins with launching and configuring an EC2 instance to host a simple web server using Apache/Nginx, helping to understand compute services and virtual server management. Access control is implemented using IAM by creating users, assigning policies, and testing secure authentication mechanisms. Static website hosting is performed using Amazon S3 by creating buckets, uploading HTML/CSS files, and enabling public access configuration. To strengthen networking knowledge, a custom VPC is created with public and private subnets, and connectivity is verified using SSH and ping commands.

The project further explores serverless computing by creating and testing AWS Lambda functions. Domain management is implemented using Route 53 by configuring hosted zones and linking domains to EC2 or S3 resources. Database management is handled through Amazon RDS by launching a managed MySQL/PostgreSQL instance, connecting to it, and performing basic CRUD operations. Messaging and notification services are demonstrated using SNS and SQS, where topics and queues are created to simulate real-time alerts and message processing systems.

Overall, this repository demonstrates end-to-end cloud infrastructure setup, secure access management, networking configuration, serverless implementation, database integration, and cloud-based messaging services. The objective of this project is to develop strong foundational knowledge in cloud computing while gaining practical exposure to real-world AWS architecture scenarios.
